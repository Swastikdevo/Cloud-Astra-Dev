Sure! Below is an example of a Django view function for a bank management system that implements several features, including account creation, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balance. The view uses the Django REST framework for a clean API implementation and includes decorators for authentication and permission management.

Make sure to install Django and Django REST framework in your environment. This code assumes you have a basic `BankAccount` model already defined with fields like `account_number`, `balance`, and `owner`.

### Django View Implementation

```python
# views.py
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from .models import BankAccount
from .serializers import BankAccountSerializer

@api_view(['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def manage_account(request):
    """
    Manage bank accounts: Create a new account, deposit money, withdraw money, 
    or check the balance based on the request.
    """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Create a new bank account
        serializer = BankAccountSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save(owner=request.user)
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

    elif request.method == 'PUT':
        # Update account details such as deposit or withdrawal
        account_number = request.data.get('account_number')
        action = request.data.get('action')  # 'deposit' or 'withdraw'
        amount = request.data.get('amount')
        
        try:
            account = BankAccount.objects.get(account_number=account_number, owner=request.user)
        except BankAccount.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Account not found.'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

        if action == 'deposit':
            account.balance += amount
            account.save()
            return Response({'message': 'Deposit successful.', 'balance': account.balance}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        elif action == 'withdraw':
            if account.balance >= amount:
                account.balance -= amount
                account.save()
                return Response({'message': 'Withdrawal successful.', 'balance': account.balance}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
            else:
                return Response({'error': 'Insufficient funds.'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

    elif request.method == 'GET':
        # Check the account balance
        account_number = request.GET.get('account_number')
        try:
            account = BankAccount.objects.get(account_number=account_number, owner=request.user)
            return Response({'account_number': account.account_number, 'balance': account.balance}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
        except BankAccount.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Account not found.'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

    return Response({'error': 'Invalid request method.'}, status=status.HTTP_405_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED)
```

### Key Components

- **Imports**: The necessary modules, including Django's REST framework features and the model and serializer dependencies.
- **@api_view**: Used to specify which HTTP methods the view can handle.
- **@permission_classes**: To enforce user authentication, ensuring only logged-in users can manage bank accounts.
- **Account Management Logic**:
  - **POST**: For creating a new account.
  - **PUT**: For depositing to or withdrawing from an account.
  - **GET**: For checking the account balance.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures that appropriate responses are given for errors such as account not found or insufficient funds.

### Notes
- Make sure you have the necessary models and serializers defined: `BankAccount` should have a unique `account_number`, `balance`, and a `ForeignKey` relationship to the `User` model. The `BankAccountSerializer` should handle validation and serialization for the `BankAccount` model.
- You can extend this view or create additional endpoints to handle more complex features, such as transaction history or account transfers, based on your application's requirements.
