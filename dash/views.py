Sure! Below is an example of a Django view function designed for a bank management system. The view includes random features such as creating a new account, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and checking the balance. To incorporate randomness, the view randomly selects one of these actions each time it is called.

Make sure you have Django set up and relevant models defined for the bank accounts. For this example, I'll assume you have a model named `Account` with fields for `account_number`, `balance`, and `owner`.

Here’s how you could implement such a view:

```python
import random
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST, require_GET
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from .models import Account

@require_GET
def random_account_action(request, account_number):
    # Get the account based on the account number
    account = get_object_or_404(Account, account_number=account_number)

    # List of possible actions
    actions = ['create_account', 'deposit', 'withdraw', 'check_balance']

    # Randomly select an action from the list
    action = random.choice(actions)

    # Initialize response dictionary
    response = {'action': action, 'account_number': account_number}

    if action == 'create_account':
        # Logic to create a new account (for demonstration, this won't actually save)
        new_account_number = generate_new_account_number()  # Your logic for generating an account number
        response.update({
            'status': 'Account created',
            'new_account_number': new_account_number,
        })
      
    elif action == 'deposit':
        deposit_amount = random.randint(10, 1000)  # Random deposit amount
        account.balance += deposit_amount
        account.save()
        response.update({
            'status': 'Deposit successful',
            'deposit_amount': deposit_amount,
            'new_balance': account.balance,
        })

    elif action == 'withdraw':
        withdraw_amount = random.randint(10, min(500, account.balance))  # Random withdraw amount not exceeding balance
        if withdraw_amount <= account.balance:
            account.balance -= withdraw_amount
            account.save()
            response.update({
                'status': 'Withdrawal successful',
                'withdraw_amount': withdraw_amount,
                'new_balance': account.balance,
            })
        else:
            response.update({
                'status': 'Withdrawal failed: Insufficient funds',
            })

    elif action == 'check_balance':
        response.update({
            'status': 'Balance retrieved',
            'balance': account.balance,
        })

    return JsonResponse(response)

def generate_new_account_number():
    # Your logic to generate a new account number
    return random.randint(10000000, 99999999)  # Just a simple example
```

### Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The view imports necessary components from Django, including `JsonResponse` for returning JSON responses and `get_object_or_404` to handle account retrieval safely.

2. **View Function**: The `random_account_action` function accepts a `request` object and `account_number` as a path parameter. It fetches the corresponding `Account` object or raises a 404 error if it doesn't exist.

3. **Random Action Selection**: A list of allowed actions is defined, from which one is randomly chosen.

4. **Action Handling**:
   - **Create Account**: This simulates account creation without saving, but in a complete app, you could implement the actual logic here.
   - **Deposit**: A random deposit amount is generated and added to the account's balance.
   - **Withdraw**: A random withdrawal amount is generated, ensuring it doesn’t exceed the available funds.
   - **Check Balance**: Simply returns the current balance of the account.

5. **Response**: A `JsonResponse` is returned detailing the action performed and any relevant information.

### Decorators:
- `@require_GET`: Ensures that the view can only be accessed via a GET request.

### Note:
Make sure to adjust the model and data handling according to your actual implementation. You might also want to implement user authentication and other security features in production code.
